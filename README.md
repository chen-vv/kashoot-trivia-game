# Kashoot! - A Multiplayer Trivia Game on Android

In this fast-paced online game, players compete to earn the highest score by answering trivia questions correctly. But watch out! Powerups introduce an additional layer of strategy and competition to the game. 

**Trivia knowledge alone will not necessarily guarantee victory. ðŸ¤“**

## Features

### Room Creation

To join a game, users can create their own game room, join a private room using a unique code, or join a public room through random matchmaking.

### Game Settings

Each game room has settings that can be adjusted by the game room creator, such as the following: 
- Maximum number of players allowed in the game
- Number of seconds allotted for answering each question
- Trivia question category and difficulty

### Scoring

In-game, players answer trivia questions sequentially to accumulate points. Points are decided based on the correctness of their answer, response speed, and powerup usage (and also the creativity of their username - just kidding!).

### Powerups

Powerups are this projectâ€™s primary distinguishing feature: they introduce an additional layer of *strategy* and *competition* to the trivia game. 

For example, we have added a powerup called **Free Lunch**, which awards the player the max number of points earned by any other user in that round. However, keep in mind that there's no such thing as a free lunch...especially when no one gets the answer right!

### Bonus: Emotes ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜†ðŸ”¥

To make gameplay more engaging, players can also send fun emotes to express their reactions in real time.
