# Kashoot! - A Multiplayer Trivia Game for Android
This project hosts live, online multiplayer trivia games, where users compete amongst themselves for the highest score. Users can create their own game rooms, join public game rooms via random matchmaking, or join private game rooms via unique game room codes.

Each game room has settings that can be adjusted by the game room creator, such as the following: 
- Number of seconds allotted for answering each question
- Trivia question category
- Trivia question difficulty
- Maximum number of players allowed in the game

In-game, players answer trivia questions sequentially to accumulate points. 

Points are decided based on: 
- Correctness
- Speed
- Powerup Usage

Powerups are this projectâ€™s primary distinguishing feature: they introduce an additional layer of strategy and competition to the base trivia game, and as a result, trivia knowledge alone will not necessarily guarantee victory.
